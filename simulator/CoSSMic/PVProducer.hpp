  Photo Voltaic Producer

  The PV producer is a producer agent that receives new production predictions,
  and then schedules the assigned loads to consume the predicted production. 
  It uses the algorithm in [1] to obtain the schedule.

  // The messages indicating the availability of a new prediction are received

  // prediction actor that will compute the new prediction functions in the 
  // background and then send a zero energy load back as a schedule command 
  // to trigger an update of the schedule for this newly updated prediction.
  //
  // One could think that this would lead to a race condition in two cases: 
  //
  // 1) There is a schedule computation ongoing when the request for updating 
  //    the prediction arrives, and the update would then cause this schedule 
  // 	to be partly computed using the old prediction and partially with the 
  // 	new prediction.
  // 2) A new load request starts the scheduling in parallel with the update 
  // 	of the prediction function, and hence can start using the old prediction
  // 	and in the middle of the computation will switch to the new one.
  // 
  // The actor model prevents both of these. For the first, since the update 
  // prediction request arrives via the PVProducer, it has to finish the 
  // previous new load request before the prediction update will be processed. 
  // this means that the ongoing scheduling will use the old prediction values.
  // The second case is covered by the same principle, in order for the 
  // scheduler to access the prediction it has to send messages to the predictor
  // and these messages will only be processed once the prediction has been 
  // updated. Hence, the schedule will be produced using the new prediction 
  // values.

  // requesting zero energy, and the allowed start interval contains the domain
  // for which there is a production prediction. Valid start times can only be

  // The different types of loads will be kept in dedicated lists that are
  // established in the new load handler, and used every time the objective 
  // function is evaluated. There is an obvious invariant that the size of the 
  // set of active loads must equal the length of the proposed start times. 
  //
  // Implementation note: A set would be a natural container, however a set 
  // will keep the elements in "sorted order" and there is no natural way to 
  // define the ordering of two consumer references. They can be tested for 
  // equality, but not for ordering. The main reason to use a set would be to 
  // ensure that the contained elements would be unique. However, this is anyway
  // taken care of by the partitioning function to be defined next.
  //
  // The standard list seems to have a major issue if functions are called on 
  // an empty list, like for instance erasing an empty list causes a 
  // segmentation fault as there is no implicit test to see if the list is 
  // empty. Hence vectors will be used, although it is probably less efficient

  // There is also a utility function that partitions the loads based on the 
  // current time now of the system clock. Clock synchronisation in distributed
  // systems is a huge topic, and this may lead to minor inaccuracies. This 
  // function will make a scan of the list of associated consumers, and based
  // on the set start times, it will allocate each consumer to one of the three
  // lists and move on to the next element in the list. Since the element

  // exponentially moving average of the time the scheduling operation has

  // A core issue with the scheduling is started jobs since their remaining 
  // energy consumption cannot be rescheduled (moved), and the job has to 
  // run to completion. This implies that its consumption from 'now' until 
  // the end of the job should be subtracted from the available predicted 
  // energy. Besides being complicated theoretically, this also requires the 
  // full load profile L(t) to be known by the predictor allowing it to compute
  // the net prediction. Since consumers in general are remote, it requires the 
  // load profile to be transferred from a remote endpoint, and then there are 
  // issues related to serialisation or a compact representation of the load 
  // profile.
  //
  // The elegant solution to this problem is to compute the schedule from a 
  // time T < 'now', where T is the earliest assigned start time for loads 
  // that have started. Then the complete duration of all loads are considered,
  // the framework in [1] can be applied to both running and not started jobs.
  // The running jobs are used in the computation, and it is only that their 
  // start times will not be changed from the already assigned time in the past
  // when the job started.
  //
  // A consequence of this is that the domain of the prediction has to be from 
  // the time T until the full prediction horizon. When a load finishes, it 
  // could have been the earliest assigned start time in the set of loads, 
  // and as such it will be another load with a start time t>T that will define
  // the earliest assigned start time for the next scheduling operation. The 
  // predictor must therefore be informed about the earliest assigned start 
  // time when a consumer cancel a load. This implies that the kill proxy 
  // management handler must send the earliest assigned start time to the 
  // predictor so that it can update the profile domain.
