  Predictor
  
  The main role of the predictor is to keep the most updated production 
  prediction in raw and integral form as interpolated functions. When the 
  prediction time series is received, it is first interpolated and then this 
  interpolated function is integrated at the same time stamps as in the original
  prediction series. 
  
  A secondary task of the predictor is to participate to the acceptance of 
  incoming scheduling requests. The mechanism is explained in the Load Scheduler
  header. Essentially all scheduled consumers will report their total energy 
  consumed at the time they finish, and then the cumulative total load is 
  computed by adding these together for each time stamp. If a new load is to 
  be admitted there must be enough spare capacity at the times of maxiumum 
  consumption of the already scheduled loads to execute the load at any of 
  these times. This is verified by the predictor.
  
  Finally, the predictor will manage the loads that have started execution. 
  These will be passed from the load scheduler as it is not supposed to stop 
  a running job, however their presence has the effect of reducing the available
  produced energy for the period the load is active, and this must be taken into
  account when predicting the energy available for not yet scheduled jobs.

 // The scheduling will always be done over a domain whose lower bound is the 
 // minimum of the current time and the earliest start time of a load (which

 // start time could move to another load's start time. In other words, the 
 // prediction function will always contain some past time history to allow 
 // a coherent scheduling and the length of this past time interval will change
 // dynamically as consumers finish. When a load finishes, the PV Producer will
 // send the new least starting time to the predictor, and if this is less than
 // now and larger than the current start of the prediction domain, the 
 // prediction and the integrated prediction will both be updated.
