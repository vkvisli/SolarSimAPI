  Interpolation
  
  This class is a functor aimed at interpolating a univariate function. It is
  fundamentally only an interface to the algorithms of the GNU Scientific 
  Library [1]. User should be aware that the GSL is released under GPL so this 
  code cannot be used in commercial applications. GSL has been chosen because 
  it is packaged with most Linux distributions, well tested after years of use,
  compatible with many platforms, and has a backing community.
  
  Another good alternative without the license restrictions would have been to
  use E. J. Mahler's SplineLibrary [2], recently released as open source. It 
  should provide the same functionality as this class entirely, but it is 
  not well documented and its popularity and developer support remains unknown.
  
  A final alternative would be to use ALGLIB [3]. The free version has 
  performance issues for larger systems, it is also released under GPL so it 
  suffers the same issues with commercial exploitation as the GSL. Finally, it 
  is a part of a larger library so one would need to compile the the full 
  library even if only the Spline interpolation algorithms will be used.
  
  ALGORITHM:
  
  Interpolation can be done in a multitude of ways, from the very simple 
  zero-order (flat sample and hold), via linear interpolation fitting a straight
  line between any two neighbouring points, to advanced polynomial methods and 
  splines. Polynomial methods works by fitting a polynomial to the data, but 
  it easily introduces oscillations for larger data sets. Splines generally 
  fit cubic polynomials to each pair of points along the function, matching the
  first and second order derivatives in the given data points. However, these
  splines can oscillate near outliers [4], and a more robust alternative would 
  be to use Akima splines [5]. This variant uses local information only, basing 
  the interpolation on the five successive data points. One should note that the 
  Akima interpolation of a sum of two functions does not equal the sum of the 
  interpolation of the two functions. 
  
  Steffen's method [6] guarantees monotonicity in the interpolation and has 
  therefore been chosen as the default method here, with the Akima spline 
  as a good candidate to consider if additivity is desired.
