  Shapley Value Reward
  
  The CoSSMic neighbourhood is modelled as a collaborative game of consumers 
  and producers. The reward of the game to the whole neighbourhood is the total 
  amount of grid energy not bought by the neighbourhood. The best fair solution 
  to distribute the reward is the Shapley value [1]. 
  
  A play for a consumer will be the selection of a candidate producer, and if 
  the consumer is refused by the producer it will make another play for 
  another. Given that taking power from the Grid is always an option, this 
  game will terminate with the successful association of the consumer with a 
  successful association of the consumer with a provider (the Grid provider 
  included). It should be noted that the association can change at any point 
  in time until the consumer actually starts the job depending on the producer's
  capacity to fulfil the assignment. However, once the job starts the consumer's
  association to the producer is frozen. The game epoch lasts until the consumer 
  has completed the job on the energy from the selected provider. 
  
  When an epoch ends, the Shapley value can be computed on the basis of 
  completed transactions. The Shapley value of a player is representing its 
  expected marginal contribution to any random coalition [2], and therefore 
  the reward for its decisions. The relations among the players are modelled 
  as weights on the edges of a graph where the edges are between a consumer 
  and the producers providing it with energy.
  
  It has been proven that computing the value exactly has exponential 
  complexity [2], and probabilistic Monte Carlo methods have been argued as 
  the preferred solution approach. However, for the special case where the 
  value of the game is captured as sum of bilateral values between two players,
  it has been shown that the Shapley value for a player can be computed with
  complexity linear to the number of associations the player has [3]. Given 
  the model in CoSSMic this amounts to adding together half the weights on the 
  edges incident to a vertex (consumer actor) in the energy transfer graph.
  
  A consequence of this is that it is only necessary to store the energy 
  exchange for consumers on the local network endpoint since energy consumption 
  by consumers on remote nodes will never affect the energy weight on any edge
  of the energy exchange graph incident to any consumer on the local node. 
  The local energy exchange weights are stored in a matrix where there is one
  row for each local consumer, and one column for each known producer.
  
  The rows are recorded as the consumers are created by the Actor Manager, and
  the columns are recorded once a load has finished execution and the Actor 
  Manager is requested by the Task Manager to delete the load, i.e. delete its
  associated Consumer Agent.
  
  When the load terminates, it also marks the end of an epoch in the game. 
  However, only one of the energy exchange weights will have changed, and this
  on an edge incident to the consumer agent representing this load. It is 
  assumed that all players (i.e. consumers) shall be rewarded by the end of an
  epoch, and this layout means that all but one consumer will receive
  the same reward as last time because none of the weights incident to these 
  nodes of the energy exchange graph have changed. 
  
  When an epoch ends, the reward calculator on the node hosting the consumer 
  agent for the terminating load will disseminate the recorded energy 
  consumption to all peer reward calculator, which will in turn reward all 
  consumers on each node.
