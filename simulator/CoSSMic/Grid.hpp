  Grid
  
  The Grid is a special type of producer that receives a schedule command. The
  default behaviour is to accept any request, although this behaviour can be 
  overloaded. The potential of having a grid with restrained capacity is one 
  reason for defining this as a separate actor. 
  
  With the default behaviour, there is essentially no reason to send the 
  request from consumers on remote endpoints (households) to a central grid 
  agent, since it is known Ã  priori that the request will be accepted. Thus 
  a grid actor can run locally and transparently respond to the local actors'
  requests.
  
  However, if one has a constraint grid or if one just want to obtain statistics
  about when and how much the grid is being used by the consumers in the 
  neighbourhood, there is a need to have the grid running as one single agent
  in the system. 
  
  The default identifier of a producer is a string 
  
	producer[HouseholdID]:[DeviceID]
	
  Where the household identifier is an unsigned integer and the device 
  identifier is an unsigned integer. The special device ID zero is reserved for
  the grid actor, so if the grid is running locally it will have the actor 
  address 
  
        producer[HouseholdID]:[0]
        
  In the same way, the household ID zero means the grid, so the global grid 
  agent will have the address 
  
	producer[0]:[0]

  // If an invalid ID is given, then the Theron's automatic naming is applied.
