  Producer
  
  A producer is a generic concept that supports two messages: 'NewLoad' which 
  indicates that a load needs energy from a producer. The producer will then 
  create a proxy representing the remote consumer requesting this load. When
  the load has executed, or if the consumer is being cancelled for some reason,
  then the consumer issues a 'KillProxy' message, and this must be acknowledged
  to prevent race conditions in distributed settings.
  
  The producer is an actor that will work locally, but it does support 
  serialisation and de-serialisation of the messages using the general 
  mechanism offered by the presentation layer. Whether it will act as an 
  actor or register with the presentation layer as an agent depends on which 
  constructor that is invoked.
