  Consumer Proxy
  
  The consumer proxy is created at the producer side when a schedule command is
  received by the Actor Manager. This indicates that a remote load should be 
  scheduled. 
  
  The consumer proxy actor will immediately register with the Load Scheduler, 
  and this will in turn initiate a schedule operation. During the schedule 
  operation the consumer will compute the weight of the load given the length
  of the consumption interval and its assigned start time. This weight is 
  fundamentally the total energy consumption by the load, plus its extension 
  to the end of the load interval. For details see [1].
